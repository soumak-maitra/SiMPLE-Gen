# SiMPLE-Gen
Simulated Mock Population of Lyman-Alpha Emitters Generator

A modular, end-to-end pipeline to generate simulated Lyman-α emitters from cosmological simulation outputs.

> **Note:** This pipeline builds upon the methodology outlined in [Weinberger et al. (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.485.1350W/abstract), which models intrinsic and transmitted Lyman-α emission based on halo properties and radiative transfer approximations.

## ⚙️ Setup

1. **Clone** the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourorg/SiMPLE-Gen.git
   cd SiMPLE-Gen
   ```

2. **Install** dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare** your raw data:

   * Ensure the necessary directories exist by running:

     ```bash
     mkdir -p data/raw data/processed
     ```
   * Place simulation files (density, temperature, ionization, velocity, halo positions & masses) in `data/raw/`.
   * Edit `SiMPLE-Gen/config.py ▶︎ INPUT_DIR` to point at that folder.

Simulation inputs live outside this repo under `data/raw/`, and outputs are written to `data/processed/` by default.

##  Running the Pipeline

Execute the master script:

```bash
python run.py
```

This calls each step in sequence: `gen.py`, `spec.py`, `abundance.py`, `assign.py`, `damping.py`.

##  Module Descriptions

* **`gen.py`**: Extracts 1D neutral-hydrogen, temperature, and velocity sightlines around halos.
* **`spec.py`**: Computes Lyman-α optical depth τ(z) along each sightline using your Voigt-profile routine.
* **`abundance.py`**: Builds a Sheth–Tormen halo mass function, Schechter UV LF, applies duty cycle, then matches halo masses ↔ UV magnitudes.
* **`assign.py`**: Defines probability distributions for rest-frame equivalent width (REW) and Lyman-α luminosity, and Monte Carlo-samples each halo’s values.
* **`damping.py`**: Convolves τ(v) with a halo-velocity Gaussian to compute the equivalent-width decrease ratio.

All file paths are centralized in **`config.py`**—no hidden hardcoded paths.
